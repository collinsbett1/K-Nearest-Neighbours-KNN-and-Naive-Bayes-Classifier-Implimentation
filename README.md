# K-Nearest-Neighbours-KNN-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Implimentation
This project consists of two colab notebooks. 

The first one applies the KNN algorithm onto the Titanic dataset while the second applied Naive Bayes model onto a spam email dataset.
## 1. Defining the Questions
### a) Specifying the Question
Build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survives or not given other variables.

Build a model that predicts whether a message is a spam or not.

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
For the projects to be declared a success we need to get an accuracy score of above 70%.

### c) Understanding the context
The sinking of the Titanic is an event that occured in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. This is after it struck an iceberg. It resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.
The task is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survives or not.

Spam emails are inappropriate and unwanted messages usually sent to breach security. These spam emails include phishing URLs, advertisements, commercial segments, and a large number of indiscriminate recipients. Thus, such content is always a hazard for the user. Machine learning has been used in recent times to protect users against spam.
The goal for this project is to create a model that has a high accuracy in predicting whether an email is spam or not.
